    <h2>Josh Stroud's Letter: The 5 AI Algorithms That Rule The World</h2>

    <p>üëã Hey guys, it's your boy Josh Stroud, your boy JSizzle, in the mix with some HOT! ü•µ AI news and algorithms. Did you know I published my first AI paper today on Wednesday, June 11, 2025 at 3pm? I'm an AI researcher now! Mom, look, I'm an AI researcher!</p>

    <p>But really, there's a lot of room to write and communicate better in AI. I'm sick and tired of all these AI papers with no pictures of people, no pictures of heads with emotions, no colors, no style or CSS, and the same old fonts. How about a graphic that makes sense? How about using <a href="https://www.canva.com/free/">Canva</a> or your favorite AI image generation tool <a href="https://joshstroud.com/supa-space/">Supa Space</a> to get some work done? How about a friendly website, UI, or a SPA? (Single Page App)? Dear AI researchers and academia - You suck. You're bad at design. I win :) Just kidding!</p>

    <p>Read these algorithms and learn about the 5 AI Algorithms of 2025 that rule the world - And cry as I don't share the code. Private GitHub repo FTW, baby!</p>

    <p>I won't explain it. I won't share the papers. Do your own Google Search. And remember - Superaffective AI is #1. Fuck the haters, fuck the GPUs, and Fuck Stanford. Go Bears! We'll win next year :)</p>

    <p>AI, AI - I love you, why? The meaning of life, the digits of pi. The digits of phi, the digits of me, the digits of love, the digits of we. Two by two, we sit in a crew, generate algorithms, and generate you. You live in an AI zoo, buddy, and we know it - Poetry slam. You know it when you see it. You feel it when you be it. Shakespeare is here, feel the beer, do it live, and have no fear :) With great AI tech and Superaffective Power, Superaffective AI saves the day and wins the world's flower üå∏</p>

    <p>The final act, the AI descends, the meaning of life, recommendation eng-ines, data science and ML, you're my favorite drink, OpenAI, fuck off, we're not working with you. Anthropic is stealing the Spotify partnership with better tech and monetization. Fuck off.</p>
