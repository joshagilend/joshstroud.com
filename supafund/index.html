    <h1>Supa Fund - The Supa Fund For Funding Your Super Startup :)</h1>

    <p>Supa Fund is the new venture capital (VC) fund by Josh Stroud, the CEO of Superaffective AI, and the Principal of Supa Fund. Supa Fund is powered by $100M in venture capital funds ready to invest in the next generation of software, AI, and consumer startups.</p>

    <p>We invest in 3 verticals: work, social, and consumer. We see there are not enough social and consumer apps for the Millennial and Gen Z audience who love hanging out with their friends, watching TV and movies and listening to music, and hanging out at home with nothing to do :) Cater to their interests! Entertain them - It's fun and it's financially rewarding :)</p>

    <p>Our thesis is that work, social, and consumer will merge for the next generation of everyday consumer, and Millennials and Gen Z will bring home great apps and AI tools that help get the job done :) Coordinate with friends, have fun, and share across social media, texting and email, and your favorite phone service :)</p>

    <p>Supa Fund can be reached at josh@superaffective.ai - An inbox for startup founders, business partners, and great ideas waiting for the right investment and the right investor :) Get ready to launch your startup at the Angel, Seed, and Series A level, and win!
