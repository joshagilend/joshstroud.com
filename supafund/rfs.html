    <h2>Consumer Work Tools</h2>

    <p>Email stormed the world in the 1990s. Google Docs stormed the world in the 2010s. ChatGPT stormed the world in the 2020s. Consumer work tools have always been central to getting work done across business, coordinating with friends, and documenting and sharing your work. Yet there's been no innovation in the core web standards or UI/UX of consumer work tools like email and SMS in over a decade. Many have tried, many have failed - Will you overthrow email and create the next wave of "Killer App" for communication and sharing? Only time will tell :) </p>

    <p>Consumer work apps we like: Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, SMS/iMessage, Google Calendar, Google Docs & The Google Docs Suite, Phone/iPhone/Android, Notetaking (We Hate All Of Them :) )</p>

    <h2>Email</h2>

    <p>Email is the way America works. With over 2B email accounts in the wild across Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, and other providers, there are more email accounts than Instagram users, YouTube accounts, and phone numbers. Gmail is pervasive as the #1 way to receive consumer email for free with a simple UX and a useful "job to be done" of sending and receiving email. Email is a web standard accepted by every email provider, every SMTP email server, and every email software vendor. Everyone loves email and getting a good "electronic letter" :) Email makes the world go round :)

    <h3>Authentication With Email</h3>
        
    Tech companies, software providers, and websites of all shapes and sizes use email as the primary and often only way to log in, authenticate users, and send communications and notifications to users of their site. Email evolved over 30 years as a login method without a clear statement of the user authentication problem, and there are now many competing alternatives which have failed to be fully adopted by the market: passkeys, magic links, multifactor SMS, and hardware multifactor authentication. What happens if your email is hacked? Users lose access to accounts like banks, social media, and, well, email, with a simple "Forgot Password" link :) Have we mentioned that consumer services have terrible customer support when you lose access to your email? Never again :) 
    
    <h3>Email Isn't Free</h3>

    Email is expensive and commercial - Users have to pay for features like extra storage, additional features, and hosting - Email is not free, and users often lose access to their email or key features of their email when they don't pay, they forget to pay, or they can't pay :) Web sites are free because commercial web site creators want the traffic - Why can't email be free? Email is run by tech giants and controlled by commercial and business interests - The internet and the web might run on email, but email is not free - Email is commercial. </p>

    <h3>Email Is International</h3>

    <p>Billions of international email users exclusively rely on commercial personal Gmail accounts to do business, communicate, and connect across a wide variety of languages. Gmail and Wordpress together form the backbone of international marketing and promotion to American consumers and businesses, with users often paying less than $10 a month for $100,000+ of business value for Chinese factories, Indian and Ukranian dev shops, and African scammers. Gmail is considered safer, more reliable, and more useful than paid email accounts, and is shared across sales, marketing, and leadership in an international business. Gmail allows this because they ignore it :)</p>

    <h3>Supa Fund Email RFS</h3>

    <p>Here's what Supa Fund is looking for in the next generation of startups working on email work tools, cool email UX, and novel email features that make email better :)</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Email Work Extensions</p>

            <p>Imagine new ways to use email. Integrate with the existing status quo, or dream bigger :) Create a new email app - Create a new email UX - Create a new email hosting service :)</p>

        </li>

        <p></p>
        <li>
            <p>Security And User Authentication In Email</p>

            <p>Are you building an integration, developer tool, web package, or mobile app to authenticate users with email? Are you working with passwords, passkeys, multifactor SMS, or hardware multifactor authentication? Do you think you have a "better mousetrap" or superior technology? Reach out to us and let us know :) #SupaFund :)</p>
        </li>

        <p></p>

        <li>
            <p>Email For Women</p>

            <p>Email decisively lives in a man's world. Can you create "Email For Women"? Email For Women is more than a theme, more than a UX - It's email designed for a feminine user. Female users love Instagram, TikTok, and chatting via text - But they don't love email. Half the world is women - Make them a better email :)</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Texting</h2>

    <h3>Texting Landscape Fragmentation</h3>

    <p>In texting today, there are four competing technologies that make up the modern texting landscape: SMS, iMessage, Android RCS, and Chinese Phone RCS. SMS is dominant as the web standard that every phone uses with messaging, image sharing, and audio sharing features. iMessage is the market leader in the United States for rich messaging including texting, photo and video sharing, audio messaging, iOS native features, and tapbacks. Android RCS is the Android competitor to iMessage used by all Android phones with similar features and a UX marred by major bugs and problems. Chinese phones use a Chinese RCS implementation which is different from Android RCS, and often features Chinese surveillance and tracking unique to China. Together, these four web standards make up the modern texting landscape and are used by 97% of mobile phones in the wild.</p>

    <h3>Messaging Apps: WhatsApp, Telegram, and "All The Rest" :)</h3>

    <p>WhatsApp is dominant as the #1 international texting solution worldwide. Traveling to any country internationally means switching to WhatsApp, and sending texts and photos home for free. WhatsApp has a great user experience, and features group messaging, voice messages, and image and video sharing features which make WhatsApp delightful and fun. Internationally, Telegram is also dominant as the "secure" mobile messaging solution to hide from surveillance, government spying and tracking, and ISP snooping. There are over 30 other messaging apps across countries, around the world, which all have 100M+ users featuring custom features, languages, and unique networks of people that use their messaging app every day. Who can forget the zany Viber marketing in 2025? #SupaFund :)</p>

    <h3>Texting Scams, Spam, And Ham-Handed Cybersecurity Takeovers</h3>

    <p>Texting and SMS are the single most used cybersecurity attack channel in the world. Everyone has received a scammy text from an international number with a poorly spelled domain linking your phone to a fake PayPal where you can "enter your password and win!" :) Texting scams and spam are the #1 way that consumer user accounts are taken over, and approximately 5% of all consumers in the world have experienced at least 1 essential account takeover in their lifetime. Over $50B is lost from the global consumer and business economy every year by texting scams, spam, and cybersecurity takeovers. #SecureYourPhone :)</p>

        <li>
            <p>New Messaging Apps: We're Game To Back You :)</p>

            <p>There might be 30 messaging apps in the world - But if you have an exciting new innovation, a groundbreaking new technology, or an insight into texting that makes texting better, we want to back you :) We believe most texting apps copy other features - They don't create features in-house, and they don't test features well. Most messaging apps have terrible features that users dislike - Looking at you scammy WhatsApp crypto scammer groups :) Across cybersecurity, UX, social network effects, and novel messaging features, we believe there's room for new messaging apps and disruptive innovation in the messaging space :) Reach out and let us know your next great idea! We're waiting :) #SupaFund </p>

            <p>Messaging Features: Marketplaces, Microtransactions, and Rich Media Sharing</p>

            <p>3 features Supa Fund thinks will be big in 2025 and beyond: creating marketplaces driven by messaging, creating microtransactions within text messaging, and new ways to share media via text. Texting is fundamental to how the world does business, and we're interested in startups creating custom apps, workflows, or websites that link well to texting. Marketplaces, microtransactions, and rich media sharing are more than mobile-friendly sites - They're doing business texting-native with texting as the fundamental form of sharing, outside the walled gardens of iOS and Android apps, outside the web, and outside reliance on social media. Think texting as the primary way of engaging with customers, beyond the web.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>SMS Mass Texting, Group Texting, And Targeted Texting Solutions</p>

            <p>From the perspective of an engineer, texting is simply a text box (it's a string! :) ). There's a lot of technology, communications infrastructure, and frontend code that make up the implementation, but from the perspective of the raw content, texting is just a text box. Sending texts to large groups of people could be a lot better - There are a lot of email mailing list providers, but few great texting mailing list providers. We want to invest in that :) Apps for sending great group texts have come and gone over the last 15 years, and we see there could be major improvements in sending group texts too. Sending targeted texts to individual people has always been a challenge. We're interested in new solutions to send targeted VIP or high-value texts to contacts across sales, marketing, and partnerships. Can you build a cloud SMS company? Let us know :) #SupaFund #AskYourDeveloper :)</p>

    <h2>Social For Millennials And Gen Z</h2>

    <p>How do millennials and Gen Z coordinate, share, and have fun with their phones on the web? That's the Social category at Supa Fund. We're not just talking social media - We're talking new ways for Millennials and Gen Z to feel connected remote and in person :) Share your favorite ideas with us! #SupaFund :)</p>

    <h2>Consumer Software For Play And Hanging Out On Your Computer Alone :)</h2>

    <p>Some of Supa Fund's favorite apps in the "Consumer Hanging Out At Home Alone" space are Spotify, YouTube, Netflix, and TikTok - But there are other apps  waiting to become the next market category leader :) What do you do when you're home alone after work, hanging out? Do you turn to your favorite Netflix show? Do you listen to music and crash on your bed? Do you watch some YouTube curated by your favorite YouTube front page? Do you read the news? Consumers spend on average 2 hours a day consuming apps at home alone in America and Europe. That's a big market and a big slice of consumer attention mind share. Consumers want better apps!</p>

    <h2>Developer Tools</h2>

    <p>As a developer, our principal Josh Stroud has seen the good and the bad of developer tools. Developer tools that he loves? GitHub and VS Code. Developer tools that he hates? Hacked Python packages, crufty ML tools, and design tools with bad UX :) Supa Fund is looking for the next generation of open source and proprietary developer tools for the next generation of developer powered by AI, collaboration, and the merging of backend, frontend, and DevOps.</p>
