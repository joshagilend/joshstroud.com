    <h1>A Letter From Josh Stroud About "The Road Not Taken", A Poem From Robert Frost</h1>

    <p>üëã Hey guys, it's your boy Josh Stroud, your boy <a href="https://joshstroud.com/jsizzle">JSizzle</a> in the mix. "The Road Not Taken" is one of my all-time favorite poems for entrepreneurs and leaders to learn about taking "the road less traveled". "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I ‚Äî I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference." I first read this poem when I was in college at UC Berkeley thinking about life - I wanted to be a leader, I wanted to be a CEO, and I wanted to do things no-one had ever done before - I wanted to be original. I wanted to make my life a work of art. This poem helped me think a lot about leadership, individuality, and making choices that defy society and break through. Never give up, never stop believing, work as hard as you can, and travel to a major country and live there for 6 months after college - I did in India :) #2015 :)

    <h2>The Road Not Taken</h2>
    <h2>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost">Robert Frost</a></h2>

    <p>
        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
        <br>And sorry I could not travel both
        <br>And be one traveler, long I stood
        <br>And looked down one as far as I could
        <br>To where it bent in the undergrowth;
        </p>
    
    <p>
        Then took the other, as just as fair,
        <br>And having perhaps the better claim,
        <br>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
        <br>Though as for that the passing there
        <br>Had worn them really about the same,
    </p>

    <p>
        And both that morning equally lay
        <br>In leaves no step had trodden black.
        <br>Oh, I kept the first for another day!
        <br>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
        <br>I doubted if I should ever come back.
    </p>

    <p>
        I shall be telling this with a sigh
        <br>Somewhere ages and ages hence:
        <br>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I‚Äî
        <br>I took the one less traveled by,
       <br>And that has made all the difference.
    </p>
