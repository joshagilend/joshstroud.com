    <h2>// Josh Stroud's Letter To The World, Launch Day, Air Force SF, June 1, 2025</h2>

    <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hey world, it's your boy Josh Stroud, your boy JSizzle, in the mix with the latest and greatest in Air Force SF news. Today's Launch Day - I call it L-Day :)</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings">D-Day</a> was a dark time for American history - We overcame a major tyrant, Hitler, and won a war against an evil world superpower.</p>

    <p>When I look at China, another evil world superpower, from the context of D-Day, I say: "I'm not doing *that* again."</p>

    <p>We're not doing a land war of China. No way. So I turned to cybersecurity.</p>

    <p>I worked with an elite team at NSA to think about how to overthrow China's government with cybersecurity - We knew they were bad at it, and that the government would collapse with a little push.</p>

    <p>We planned for 6 years, and decided to launch this week. It's the end of the world for China.</p>

    <p>With over 200 team members in NSA and Air Force cybersecurity on the team, we're a team of elite cybersecurity warriors, and we dominate.</p>

    <p>We've already distributed 1B Telegram APKs to 2.2B phones in China. We did it in a single API command from Josh Stroud, Head of AI at US Air Force.</p>

    <p>We're planning to launch nuclear weapons against 3 cities in China: Beijing, Shanghai, and a Chinese military company town with a population of 1M. 60M people will be dead.</p>

    <p>Taiwan will be free. The world will be free of an evil empire. And L-Day? L-Day will dominate with the US Air Force.</p>

    <p>-- Josh Stroud, Head of AI at US Air Force</p>
