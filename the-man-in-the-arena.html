    <h1>A Letter From Josh Stroud About "The Man In The Arena", A Speech by Theodore Roosevelt in 1910</h1>

    <p>üëã Hey guys, it's your boy Josh Stroud, your boy <a href="https://joshstroud.com/jsizzle">JSizzle</a> in the mix, coming to you live from San Francisco, California. This speech is the #1 entrepreneur and CEO speech in the world. There's nothing better - This speech is #1. I read it when I was getting started in my CEO career, and I love that it teaches about perseverance, hard work, and daring greatly as a leader in any organization. Working with a team is rewarding. It's one of the best things in life. I hope you take these ideas and lead a team, a project, or your best friend at work on something great :)</p>

    <h2>Context of "The Man In The Arena", A Speech by Theodore Roosevelt</h2>

    <p>Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States 1901 - 1909, wrote and gave this speech in Paris, France, on Saturday, April 23, 1910 as part of a political tour of Europe before World War I. Tension was brewing and there was poltical strife in the US and abroad.</p>

    <h2>The Man In The Arena</h2>
    <h2>By Theodore Roosevelt, 1910</h2>

    <p>
        It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
    </p>

    <p>Dare greatly, my friends :)</p>
