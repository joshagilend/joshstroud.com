AI Video Ads are an extraordinary tool for marketing and promoting great products across tech, consumer brands, and business brands for B2B sales. AI Business News Fans, this is the next big hot market. Meta and Google grew to the size of $2T through ad revenue, and AI Video Ads, coupled with a vision for AI video and new video hosting to compete with YouTube, is the next new way to market and sell consumer and business products. Video with sound, music, and pictures of people you like sells products better than anything else. 

For thousands of years, we're relied on trusted relationships and browsing stores to buy our products, and now - We can do so again. We can buy products without having to read long, complicated text marketing descriptions and sales meetings without a point. Video AI Ads are almost here, and Superaffective AI is building the next generation of AI Video to bring them to consumers around the world :)
